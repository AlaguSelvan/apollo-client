title: Migrating to Apollo Client 3.0
---

This article walks you through migrating your application from Apollo Client 3.0 to 4.0.

## Updating imports

> To simplify the process of converting your `import` declarations, we provide an automated [transform](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/main/scripts/codemods/ac3-to-ac4) based on [`jscodeshift`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jscodeshift). Note that this transform merely moves `import` specifiers between `import` declarations, without checking for proper usage of the imported values. Since the transform cannot take care of everything, pay close attention to any errors produced by TypeScript or your bundling tools, and be sure to verify all changes made by the transform. A more detailed list of caveats can be found in the [`README.md`](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/main/scripts/codemods/ac3-to-ac4#known-limitations).

### @apollo/client to @apollo/client/react

React Apollo HOC and component functionality is no longer included in the `@apollo/client` package, and now only available through `@apollo/client/react`:

```js
// Importing react hooks in Apollo Client v3:
import { useQuery, useMutation, ApolloClient } from '@apollo/client';
// What that same import will look like in v4:
import { ApolloClient } from '@apollo/client';
import { useQuery, useMutation } from '@apollo/client/react';
```
