title: Migrating to Apollo Client 4.0
---

This article walks you through migrating your application from Apollo Client 3.0 to 4.0.

## Updating imports



### @apollo/client to @apollo/client/react

React Apollo HOC and component functionality is no longer included in the `@apollo/client` package, and now only available through `@apollo/client/react`:

```js
// Importing react hooks in Apollo Client v3:
import { useQuery, useMutation, ApolloClient } from '@apollo/client';
// What that same import will look like in v4:
import { useQuery, useMutation, ApolloClient } from '@apollo/client/react';
```
