title: Why Apollo Client?
description: Why choose Apollo Client to manage your data?
---

Apollo Client is a state management library that simplifies managing remote and local data with GraphQL. Apollo Client's intelligent caching and declarative approach to data fetching can help you iterate faster while writing less code. Additionally, if you need custom functionality, you can create your dream client by building extensions on top of Apollo Client.

Let's jump right into what Apollo Client can offer you! ðŸš€

## Declarative data fetching

Apollo Client handles the request cycle from start to finish, including tracking loading and error states. There's no middleware or boilerplate code to set up before making your first request, and you don't need to worry about transforming or caching responses. All you have to do is describe the data your component needs and let Apollo Client do the heavy lifting. ðŸ’ª

Apollo Client's `useQuery` hook leverages React's [Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) to bind a query to a component, enabling that component to render a query's results immediately. The `useQuery` hook encapsulates the logic for retrieving your data, tracking loading and error states, and updating your UI. This encapsulation makes integrating query results into your presentational components a breeze!

Let's see what this looks like in practice with Apollo Client and React:

```jsx
function ShowDogs() {
  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(GET_DOGS);
  if (error) return <Error />;
  if (loading) return <Fetching />;

  return <DogList dogs={data.dogs} />;
}
```

In the example above, we're using the `useQuery` hook to fetch dogs from our GraphQL server and display them in a list. Once our data comes back, our `<DogList />` component will reactively update to display the new data.

When switching to Apollo Client, you'll find you can remove much of your previous code related to data management. Some teams have reported deleting thousands of lines of code!

Though you'll find yourself writing less code with Apollo Client, that doesn't mean you have to compromise on features. [The `useQuery` hook](./data/queries#usequery-api) supports advanced features like an optimistic UI, refetching, and pagination.

## Combining local & remote data

Thousands of developers have told us that Apollo Client excels at managing remote data, equating to roughly 80% of their data needs. But what about local data (e.g., global flags or device API results), which makes up the other 20% of the pie?

Apollo Client includes [local state management](local-state/local-state-management/) features straight out of the box, enabling you to use your Apollo cache as the single source of truth for your application's data.

By using Apollo Client's local state functionality, you can include local fields _and_ remotely fetched fields in the same query:

```js
const GET_DOG = gql`
  query GetDogByBreed($breed: String!) {
    dog(breed: $breed) {
      images {
        url
        id
        isLiked @client
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

In the above example, we're querying the [local-only field](./local-state/managing-state-with-field-policies) `isLiked` and fetching data from our GraphQL server. Your components contain local and remote data; now, your queries can too!

Managing your data with Apollo Client lets you take advantage of GraphQL as a unified interface for _all_ of your data. Using the [Apollo Client Devtools](./development-testing/developer-tooling#apollo-client-devtools), you can inspect both your local and remote schemas using GraphiQL.

## Zero-config caching

Caching a graph is no easy task, but we've spent years solving this problem. Normalization is the key to maintaining consistent data across multiple components in an application.

One of the key features that sets Apollo Client apart from other data management solutions is its local, in-memory, [normalized](./caching/overview#data-normalization) cache.

The Apollo Client cache is easy to get started with, and [configure](./caching/cache-configuration) as you need:

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from "@apollo/client";

const client = new ApolloClient({
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Once your in-memory cache has been created, whenever Apollo Client receives query response data it will automatically identify the distinct objects (those with a `__typename` and an `id` property) into their own entities and store them within the cache. This guarantees that returning a value from a mutation with an id will automatically update any queries that fetch the object with the same id. It also ensures that two queries which return the same data will always be in sync.

Let's look at some practical examples at how the cache can help make your application efficient!

The below query, `GET_ALL_DOGS`, fetches a list of dogs and their `displayImage`s:

```js
const GET_ALL_DOGS = gql`
  query GetAllDogs {
    dogs {
      id
      breed
      displayImage
    }
  }
`;
```

The below mutation, `UPDATE_DISPLAY_IMAGE`, updates a single dog's `displayImage`:

```js
const UPDATE_DISPLAY_IMAGE = gql`
  mutation UpdateDisplayImage($id: String!, $displayImage: String!) {
    updateDisplayImage(id: $id, displayImage: $displayImage) {
      id
      displayImage
    }
  }
`;
```

If we run the `UPDATE_DISPLAY_IMAGE` mutation, we want to ensure that our newly updated dog's image is updated everywhere in our application.

Let's go back to our `GET_ALL_DOGS` query from the previous example that displays a list of dogs. What if we want to transition to a detail page for a specific dog? Since we've already fetched information on each dog, we don't want to refetch the same information from our server. Thanks to Apollo Client's cache policies API, we can connect the _dogs_ between two queries so we don't have to fetch information that we know is already available.

Here's what our query for one dog looks like:

```js
const GET_DOG = gql`
  query GetDog {
    dog(id: "abc") {
      id
      breed
      displayImage
    }
  }
`;
```

Below we define a custom [`FieldPolicy`](./caching/advanced-topics/#cache-redirects) that returns a reference to the cached `Dog` data, which our query can then use to retrieve that data.

```js
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from "@apollo/client";

const cache = new InMemoryCache({
  typePolicies: {
    Query: {
      fields: {
        dog(_, { args, toReference }) {
          return toReference({
            __typename: "Dog",
            id: args.id,
          });
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

const client = new ApolloClient({ cache });
```

## Vibrant ecosystem

Apollo Client is easy to get started with, but extensible for when you need to build out more advanced features. If you need custom functionality that isn't covered with `@apollo/client`, such as app-specific middleware or cache persistence, you can leverage the Apollo Link architecture to plug-in new network stack functionality.

This flexibility makes it simple to create your dream client by building extensions on top of Apollo. We're always really impressed by what our contributors have built on top of Apollo - check out some of their packages:
